# ð“ƒ•DeSQL SQL Parser

<!-- clarify relation to ð“†¤DBay -->

ðŸš§ Work in progress ðŸš§


## To Do

* **[â€“]** add location information
* **[â€“]** parse multiple statements
* **[â€“]** at present, comments and stuff the parser doesn't understand are left out of the result
  which constitues silent failure; ensure 100% source code coverage (whitespace may be left out,
  but not comments and also not unsyntactic garbage)
